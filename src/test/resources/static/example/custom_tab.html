            <b>How to use:</b>

            A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul,
            like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.
            I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot,
            which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy,
            my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence,
            that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke
            at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.
